# USN(United States of Noakhali)  Apartment Rent Prediction

A machine learning(software engineering) project to **predict apartment rent prices** in the fictional country **United States of Noakhali (USN)**.  
This end-to-end project uses **Flask**, **Python**, and **ML models** built with **scikit-learn** to provide rent predictions based on apartment features such as area, number of rooms, and city.
